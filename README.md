# 📊 Advanced Data Visualization

This repository contains two data analysis projects focusing on **Heart Disease Analysis** and **Movie Rating Analysis**. The projects leverage **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas** to visualize patterns and generate meaningful insights from the datasets.

## 🔍 Project Overview

1. **Heart Disease Data Analysis**  
   - Explores key health factors contributing to heart disease.    
   - Identifies potential risk factors through correlation heatmaps and distribution plots.

2. **Movie Rating Data Analysis**  
   - Analyzes movie ratings from a dataset to understand audience preferences.  
   - Visualizes rating distributions, genre trends, and relationships between user ratings and movie popularity.  
   - Helps identify patterns in movie ratings based on genres, release years, and viewer demographics.
